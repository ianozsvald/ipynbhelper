IPython Notebook to asciidoc helper script (by @ogrisel)

Originally from a gist by Olivier https://gist.github.com/ogrisel/6622819 which is built on scripts by @minrk. I've added an MIT license. Olivier notes that this should probably be integrated into nbconverter.

Used by Ian Ozsvald and Micha Gorelick for their High Performance Python book: http://ianozsvald.com/2013/10/07/public-python-survey-for-high-performance-python-book-your-input-much-appreciated/
